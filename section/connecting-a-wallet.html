    <h2>Wallet setup</h2>
    This section specifies how the user can set up a [=wallet address=].

    <h3>Terms</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>Web Monetization page</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Refers to the browser's UI for managing Web Monetization settings, accessible via a browser specific URI. In Chrome, this is located at `chrome://webmonetization`.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Interactive grant</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Open Payments requires outgoing payment [=grant=] requests to be interactive. When a grant request is interactive, it means explicit interaction by an individual (typically the clientâ€™s end user) is a required step in the delegation process.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            After the grant request is made, the client must poll for a Grant Continuation request so the [=AS=] knows to issue an access token.
        </dd> 

        <dt><dfn>Redirect URI</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            The redirect URI is an URL the user is redirected to in order to accept or decline the outgoing payment grant ([=interactive grant=]) when conneting their [=wallet=] to the browser.
        </dd> 
    </dl>

    <h3>Conencting a wallet</h3>
    <p>The user can initiate the wallet setup from the [=web monetization page=], which provides a UI for specifying the [=wallet address=], and the budget. </p>
    <p class="note">An example of such a UI could be an "Add a Wallet" button that opens a dialog for entering this information, with an "Add" button that starts the wallet connection process when clicked.</p>

    <p>To process the wallet setup, given a string <var>walletAddress</var>, number <var>budget</var> and boolean <var>renewMonthly</var>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Let <var>walletAddress</var> (string) be the [=wallet address=] provided by the user, <var>budget</var> (number) be the budget that the user wants to use for Web Monetization and <var>renewMonthly</var> (boolean) the option to renew the budget every month.
        </li>
        <li>
            Retrieve wallet address information by performing a GET request on the wallet address - <a href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/wallet-address-server/operations/get-wallet-address/">get wallet address Open Payments request.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>authServer</var> represent the [=AS=] URL obtained from the response in step 2.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>interval</var> be an ISO 8601 repeating interval if <var>renewMonthly</var> is `true`.
        </li>
        <li>
            Send a <a href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request/">grant request</a>, that requests access to <a href="https://openpayments.dev/introduction/op-concepts/#outgoing-payment">outgoing payments</a> and <a href="https://openpayments.dev/introduction/op-concepts/#quote">quotes</a> to the <var>authServer</var>, given the <var>walletAddress</var>, <var>budget</var> and <var>interval</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>redirectUri</var> be the [=redirect URI=] obtained from the grant request in step 5.
        </li>
        <li>
            Open the <var>redirectUri</var> in a new tab to redirect the user to its wallet [=IdP=], where the user can accept or decline the grant. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>continueUri</var> be the URI at which the client instance can make continuation requests, obtained from the grant request in step 5.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>wait</var> be the wait time in seconds, obtained from the grant request in step 5.</li>
        <li>
            Start polling the <var>continuationUri</var> to get the information about the grant state every <var>wait</var> seconds.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    If the [=AS=] responds with HTTP status code 200, a finalized grant is returned - the user accepted the grant and the information (TBD: define what informations can be saved) can be saved in the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the [=AS=] responds with HTTP status code 401, the user rejected the grant and the process stops.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            
        </li>
    </ol>
