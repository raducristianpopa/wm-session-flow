      The specification defines the browser implementation for setting up a
      wallet and managing the payment session flow. To start using web
      monetization in a browser, the user must add a wallet to enable web
      monetization payments while browsing the web. When a user visits a [=web monetized website=],
      the payment session begins, facilitated through a series of
      [[[openpayments]]] (<abbr title="Open Payments">OP</abbr>) calls.
      This document details the procedures and protocols involved.
