    <p>This specification defines a user wallet integraction and the flow of a web monetization (<abbr title="Web Monetization">WM</abbr>) [=session=] in a browser.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The specification defines the browser implementation for setting up a
      [=user wallet=] and managing the [=WM session=] flow. To start using web
      monetization in a browser, the user must add a wallet to enable web
      monetization payments while browsing the web. When a user visits a [=web-monetized website=],
      the [=WM session=] begins, facilitated through a series of
      [[[openpayments]]] (<abbr title="Open Payments">OP</abbr>) calls.
      This document details the procedures and protocols involved.

  <section id="wallet-setup">
    <h2>Wallet setup</h2>
    This section specifies how the user can set up a [=user wallet=] and how to disconnect it.

    <h3>Terms</h3>

    <p><dfn>Wallet page</dfn> refers to the browser's UI for managing [=user wallets=], accessible via a browser specific URI. In Chrome, this is located at `chrome://webmonetization/wallet`.</p>
    <p><dfn>Redirect URI</dfn> is an URL the user is redirected to in order to accept or decline the [=outgoing payment grant request=] when connecting a [=user wallet=] to the browser.</p>

    <h3>Open Payment requests</h3>

    <p><dfn>Outgoing payment grant request</dfn> is an interactive <a href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request/">OP grant request</a> to the [=authentication server=] of the [=user wallet provider=] to connect the [=user wallet=] to the browser.
      It requires

      <h3>Connect a wallet</h3>

      <p>
        The user can <dfn data-lt="initiation of the wallet setup">initiate a [=user wallet=] setup</dfn>
        from the [=wallet page=], which provides a UI for
        specifying the [=user wallet address=], the [=pay rate=], and the
        [=spending limit=]. An example of such a UI could be an
        `"Add a Wallet"` button that opens a dialog for entering this information,
        with an `"Add"` button that starts the wallet connection process when clicked.
      </p>
      </p>
      To connect a [=user wallet=], run these steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Let |userWalletAddress| be the [=user wallet address=] provided by the user during the [=initiation of the wallet setup=].</li>

        <li>Let |amount| be the amount provided by the user during the [=initiation of the wallet setup=].</li>

        <li><dfn>Get user wallet address step</dfn>. Send a [=get wallet address request=] to the |userWalletAddress|.</li>

        <li>Let |authServer| be the [=authentication server=] from the response of the [=get user wallet address step=].</li>

        <li>Let |walletPageUri| be the URI of the [=wallet page=].</li>

        <li>Let |clientNonce| is a randomly generated integer.

        <li><dfn>Outgoing payment grant step</dfn>. Send an [=outgoing payment grant request=] to the |authServer| given the |userWalletAddress|, |amount|, |walletPageUri| and |clientNonce|.</li>

        <li>Let |redirectUri| be [=redirect URI=] from the response of the [=outgoing payment grant step=].</li>

        <li>Load the |redirectUri| in the current tab, which should display a page where the user is prompted to click an accept button to authorize the [=wallet provider=] to connect the [=user wallet=] with the browser. 

        <li>Let |accessToken| be the [=access token=] from the response of the [=outgoing payment grant step=].</li>
        <li>
          Send the [=continuation grant request=] with the |accessToken| in the authentification header and |interactRef| in the request body as `interact_ref` field.
        </li>

        <li>Let |payRate| be the [=pay rate=] from the [=initiation of the wallet setup=].</li>
        <li>Let |spendingLimit| be the [=spending limit=] from the [=initiation of the wallet setup=].</li>

        <li>Let |assetCode| be the [=asset code=] from the response of the [=get user wallet address step=].</li>
        <li>Let |assetScale| be the [=asset scale=] from the response of the [=get user wallet address step=].</li>
        <li>Let |continuationURI| be the [=continuation URI=] from the response of the [=outgoing payment grant step=].</li>

        <li>Set the [=user wallet details=] to a {{UserWalletDetails}} object initalized with
          `address` set to |userWalletAddress|, `assetCode` set to |assetCode|,
          `assetScale` set to |assetScale|, `payRate` set to |payRate|, `spendingLimit` set to |spendingLimit|,
          `accessToken` set to |accessToken| and `continuationURI` set to |continuationURI|.</li>

        <li>Show a message on the [=wallet page=] indicating that the [=user wallet=] was successfully connected.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Disconnect a wallet</h3>
      The user can disconnect their previously set-up [=user wallet=] through the [=wallet page=], which provides a UI for this. For instance, a `"Disconnect the Wallet"` button could be provided, initiating the disconnection process after the user gives explicit confirmation.
      <p>
        To disconnect a previously connected [=user wallet=], run these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Let |accessToken| be the `accessToken` of the [=user wallet details=].</li>
          <li>Let |continuationURI| be the `continuationURI` of the [=user wallet details=].</li>
          <li>Revoke the [=outgoing payment grant request=] sent during the
            [=outgoing payment grant step=] by sending a [=cancel grant request=] to
            |continuationURI| with the given |accessToken|.</li>
          <li>Set the [=user wallet details=] to an empty {{UserWalletDetails}} object.</li>

  <section>
    <h2>Monetization status</h2>

    <p>
      The user can disable web monetization completely or disable it per-[=origin=]
      basis through the [=wallet page=]. The page provides a user interface that allows
      them to adjust their preferences accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      A website can disable web monetization for itself and/or its subdocuments by setting
      the <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/references/permissions-policy-monetization/">
        `monetization`</a> [=policy-controlled feature=].
    </p>

    <p>
      A website can also restrict web monetization to [=website wallet addresses=] of certain
      [=origins=] by using the
      <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/references/csp-monetization-src/">
        `monetization-src`
      </a> directive in the [=content security policy=].
    </p>

    <p>
      <dfn>Monetization is disabled</dfn> given a {{Document}} |document| if either of the following conditions apply:
      <ul>
        <li>The user preferences specify that web monetization is either completely
          disabled or disabled specifically for the [=Document/origin=] of the |document|.</li>
        <li>The |document| is not [=allowed to use=] the
          <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/references/permissions-policy-monetization/">
            `monetization`</a> feature.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <dfn>Monetization is disabled for a wallet</dfn> given a {{Document}} |document|
      and a [=website wallet address=] |walletAddress| if the
      <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/references/csp-monetization-src/">
        `monetization-src`
      </a> directive in the [=content security policy=] of the |document| restricts
      the |walletAddress|'s [=origin=].
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Session flow</h2>

    <p>
      As long as the user lands on a [=web-monetized website=] or interacts with
      [=web-monetized media=], and their preferences allow monetization for
      that site, the browser will attempt to initiate one or more
      [=monetization sessions=]. This section outlines the session flow, including
      when a session starts and stops, and how the browser facilitates payments
      from the user’s wallet to the website.
    </p>

    <h3>Open Payments requests</h3>

    <p><dfn>Incoming payment grant request</dfn> is a non-interactive
      <a href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request/">OP grant request</a> to
      the [=authentication server=] of the [=website wallet provider=] to establish
      a payment flow from the [=user wallet=] to the [=website wallet=]. It requires
      a [=website wallet address=] given as |websiteWalletAddress| and an |amount|.
      The request body is formatted as follows:
      <pre class="nohighlight">
        {
          "access_token": {
            "access": [{
               "type": "incoming-payment",
                    "actions": ["create"],
                    "identifier": |websiteWalletAddress|
                }],
                "limits": {
                    "debitAmount": {
                        "amount": |amount| // FIXME: what it is set to?
                    }
                },
                // FIXME: is it website wallet address or user wallet address?
                "client": |websiteWalletAddress|
            }
        }
      </pre>
      and in response the server returns:
      <pre class="nohighlight">
        {
          continue: {
            access_token: {
              value: string // <a href="#dfn-access-token">access token</a>
            },
            uri: string, // <a href="#dfn-continuation-uri">continuation URI</a>

          }
        }
        </pre>
    </p>

    <p><dfn>Incoming payment request</dfn> is an
      <a href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/resource-server/operations/create-incoming-payment">OP request</a>
      to the [=resource server=] of the [=website wallet provider=] for creating a [=payment bucket=] that
      accepts funds during the monetization session from the user.
      It requires
      <ul>
        <li>[=access token=] provided by the [=incoming payment grant request=],
          to be used in the authentication header;</li>
        <li>[=website wallet address=] given as |websiteWalletAddress|.</li>
      </ul>
      The |expiresAt| is an ISO string set to the
      current date plus 10 minutes.
      <div class="note">
        The |expiresAt| field is set to the current date plus 10 minutes, as users
        typically spend an average of 5 minutes on a website, making it unnecessary
        to keep the session active longer. Ideally, the browser should terminate
        the session when the user navigates away from the site. However, if that
        doesn’t happen for any reason, the expiration date will ensure the session
        is ended. If the session expires before the user leaves the website, the
        browser should reinitialize the session.
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        FIXME: The use of 10 minutes long |expiresAt| unnecessarily complicates things. The browser
        should handle shutting down the session when it is no longer active.

    <h3>Session lifecycle</h3>

    <p>
      A <dfn data-lt="active session list">active sessions</dfn> is used to store
      information about active monetization sessions. The storage is implemented
      as a linked list of {{MonetizationSession}} objects.
    </p>

    <pre class="idl">
        dictionary MonetizationSession {
          HTMLLinkElement linkElement; // monetization HTML link

          unsigned long assetScale; // asset code of the wallet
          USVString paymentBucketURI; // a payment bucket created for the session
        };
      </pre>

    <p>
      As soon as a [=web-monetized website=]'s document becomes [=Document/fully active=],
      [=document-wide sessions are initiated=] for a {{Document}} of the website.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a {{Document}} becomes not [=Document/fully active=] then
      [=suspend session=] for it and all its [=child navigables=].
    </p>

    <p>
      If any of the conditions outlined in the
      <a href="https://webmonetization.org/specification/#link-type-monetization">
        link fetch and processing timing
      </a> are met for a
      <a href="https://webmonetization.org/specification/#link-type-monetization">
        monetization
      </a> [^link^] element, then the associated [=session is suspended=], and
      a new [=session is initiated=] for the given link element.
    </p>

    <p>
      As soon as the user starts interacting with a [=web-monetized media=] on a
      website, [=sessions are initiated=] scoped to the [=media element=].
    </p>

    <p>
      As soon as the user stops interacting with a [=web-monetized media=] on a
      website, any [=media element=] associated [=session is suspended=].
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Monetization typically starts when the user loads a website, switches back to
      the browser, or switches to an existing tab with an already loaded website.
      For media elements, monetization begins as soon as the user interacts with
      them, such as watching a video or listening to audio, and stops when the user
      ceases the interaction.

    </p>

    <p>
      To <dfn data-lt="sessions are initiated">initiate sessions scoped to</dfn>

        <li><dfn>Incoming payment grant step</dfn>. Send an

      </ol>

    <h3>Payment distribution</h3>

    <div class="note">
      <p>
        The payment algorithm distributes payments equally between
        [=website wallets=] of the [=active sessions=], with payments made at equal time
        intervals, defaulting to `1s` if a website wallet can accept the given amount.
        If the website wallet's cannot accommodate the default amount, the payment
        is delayed by a number of seconds to accommodate the increased amount as
        defined by the [=asset scale=] of the [=website wallet=].
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as the first session is added to the [=active sessions=], each session
        from the [=active sessions=] is processed one by one, with payments sent accordingly,
        and the processing continues until the [=active sessions=] list is empty.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <p>
        Website wallets with an asset code different from the user wallet's asset
        code are <b>ignored</b> until the exchange rate issue is resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current design suggests that the browser must rely on third-party currency
        conversion services to estimate the payment amount for the website wallet.
        However, handling the conversion rate seems like a natural part of OpenPayments,
        as it removes the need for the browser to estimate exchange rates, leaving this
        task to the wallet provider that performs the actual currency conversion.
        This approach also eliminates the browser's dependency on third-party services,
        resulting in a simpler design.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      A <dfn>session loop</dfn> is an asynchronous process that iterates through
      the [=active sessions=], during which the browser [=sends payments=]
      to the [=website wallet=] associated with each session from the [=active sessions=].
    </p>

    <p>
      A <dfn>currently processed session</dfn> is a {{MonetizationSession}} object from the
      [=active sessions=] that the browser is processing within the [=session loop=].
    </p>

    <p>
      A <dfn>session loop timeout</dfn> is the delay before the browser
      [=sends payment=] to the [=website wallet=] of the [=currently processed session=]
      and then proceeds to the next session from the [=active session list=].
    </p>

    <p>
      A <dfn>payment amount</dfn> is the payment made to a [=website wallet=] of
      the [=currently processed session=].
    </p>

    <p>
      To compute [=payment amount=] and [=session loop timeout=]</dfn>
      for the [=currently processed session=] given as |session|, run these steps:
      <ul>
        <li>Let |defaultTimeout| be `1`.</li>
        <li>Let |userWalletDetails| be the [=user wallet details=].</li>
        <li>Let |defaultAmount| be `userWalletDetails.payRate / 3600`.</li>
        <li>Let |assetScale| be `session.assetScale`.</li>
        <li>Let |minimalAmount| be `1 / Math.pow(10, |assetScale|)` using {{Math/pow()}}.</li>

        <li>Then <dfn data-lt="computed payment amount">payment amount is computed</dfn> as:<br>
          <code>max(|defaultAmount|, minimalAmount)</code> using {{Math/max()}}.
        </li>

        <li>Then <dfn data-lt="computed session loop timeout">session loop timeout is computed</dfn> as:<br>
          <code>max(|defaultTimeout|, ceil(|minimalAmount| / |defaultAmount|))</code>
          using {{Math/ceil(x)}}, {{Math/max()}}.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Session loop</h3>

    <p>
      To <dfn>start session loop</dfn>, [=schedule next session processing=] given null.
    </p>

    <p>A <dfn>session processing runnable</dfn> is a function called
      in [=session loop timeout=] which [=processes current session=].</p>

    <p>
      To <dfn>schedule next session processing</dfn> given an optional |session|, run these steps:
      <ol>
        <li>[=Set next session=] given the |session|.</li>
        <li>If the [=currently processed session=] is null, then return.</li>

      run these steps:
      <ol>
        <li>If the [=active session list=] is empty, set the
          [=currently processed session=] to null.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, |session| is null or if there are no sessions following |session|, set the
